Hi, I'm Piotr, a senior software engineer from Poland. I've been working remotely for the past 6 years, focusing on backend development and building scalable systems.

## About me

My fascination with computers and software started early. I began my programming adventure by learning Java and writing simple Minecraft mods – the possibilities of writing text in a code editor and watching amazing things happen completely amazed me.

When I entered college, I quickly realized that theory and simple exercises weren't enough for me. I really wanted to build real-world applications, so I decided to learn Python and pursue career in web development.

I genuinely love engineering and am always seeking new challenges. Whether I'm designing architecture or implementing complex solutions, I strive to do my best work. I just love building in general and learning new things.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading nonfiction, history, and fantasy books. I'm also into gaming and kickboxing.

## Skills

Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies and had opportunities to:

- Build monoliths, microservices, and distributed systems (Python, Golang, Elixir)
- Work with relational and non-relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
- Using various message brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Design REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs
- Build asynchronous job processing using different frameworks (Celery, Temporal)
- Write comprehensive documentation including ADRs, API specs, and RFCs
- Implement testing strategies using frameworks like pytest, or ExUnit
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and CircleCI
- Configure monitoring and tracing with tools like Sentry, or Datadog

### Backend

My primary expertise is backend development. I'm comfortable building both monolithic and microservice architectures, and I have experience working with distributed systems.

**Python** is my most production-ready language, because majority of the projects I've worked on used it, typically with **Django**. I also often used **FastAPI**, which is one of my favorite backend frameworks.

**Go** is probably my favorite (or second favorite!) language. I absolutely love Go for its simplicity and the powerful tools provided in the standard library. It has been a breath of fresh air in a time full of complexity and new JS frameworks for every day of a week. Go has been my go-to choice for building high-throughput APIs, CLI tools, and background workers when performance is critical.

I started learning **Elixir** over a year ago when I wanted a full-stack framework that wasn't Django. I quickly fell in love with the capabilities of Elixir, Erlang, and the BEAM VM. Phoenix framework was exactly what I was looking for, and since then, Elixir and Phoenix have been the main drivers for my private projects. The Elixir community, while smaller, feels much more engaging and higher quality.

### Frontend

I'm not primarily a frontend developer, but I have solid frontend experience with **React** and **SvelteKit**, and I can handle full-stack requirements when needed. My Angular knowledge is probably obsolete at this point.

### Infrastructure

I'm comfortable tackling infrastructure problems including **Docker**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD** setups. While I'm not an expert in this field, I'm not intimidated by these challenges either.
