Hi, my name is Piotr. I am a software engineer from Poland, currently working
full-time in Germany.

## About

I have always been interested in computers and software. I started my
programming adventure quite early, by learning Java and writing some simple
Minecraft mods. The possibilities of simply writing a text in a code editor and
watching some crazy things happening amazed me.

Upon entering college, I quickly realized that I was bored with just theory and
simple exercises. As a result, I decided to learn Python and pursue a career in
web development as soon as possible.

I genuinely love engineering and I am always looking for new challenges. I
always strive to do my best whether itâ€™s designing or implementing solutions. I
just like building things in general. I am eager to explore various concepts
and share my knowledge with others. Creating content for my blog allows me to
do both regularly (although I am not too consistent with it).

Besides programming, I also like reading nonfiction and fantasy books, playing
video games, and practicing kickboxing.

## Skills

My main area of expertise is backend development. I also have frontend
experience with both React and Angular but 'the other side' never got my
attention as much as the backend. I am also familiar with DevOps and cloud
concepts, including Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. Still, I would not call myself
a DevOps (I wouldn't even dare to!) because usually infrastructure was out of
my scope.

Coming back to the backend, most of my 'production' experience is with Python,
simply because it was the language I used at my first job. I started with
Django, but then I discovered FastAPI which quickly became my favorite
framework. I also have experience with Go, which I use a lot for my personal
projects and I sort of think that this is a perfect language for backend
development (but this is probably a topic for an article).

During my career, I had opportunities to build both monoliths and
microservices, work with relational and non-relational databases, use various
message brokers, build REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs, build distributed systems,
and more. I have participated in all stages of the software development
process, from designing architecture to implementing and deploying the
solution. I wrote a lot of documentation including ADRs, API specs (using
OpenAPI), and RFCs. I have experience with various testing frameworks and
tools, like pytest (the best testing framework ever) and CI/CD tools like
GitHub Actions or CircleCI. I also worked with tracing and monitoring tools
like Sentry and Datadog.

## Contact

You can find the links at the top of the page, next to my photo. You can
contact me directly via email or on LinkedIn. Projects I'm working on can be
found on GitHub, although I rarely finish any project and most of them stay
private. On top of that, I occasionally write technical articles and post them
on Substack, Hashnode, DEV, and HackerNoon. If you find any of my content
interesting, would be really great to see you subscribing to the newsletter on
Substack :)
